# OMS Monorepo (M0 - Foundations)

This repository is reset to the learning-friendly M0 foundation for an event-driven Order Management System.

- Start with design docs in `docs/`.
- Contracts (Protobuf) live in `proto/`.
- Code and deployments will be added in M1+ milestones.

See:
- docs/architecture.md
- docs/event-catalog.md
- docs/api.md

Next step (M1): scaffold minimal Gateway + Orders with Docker Compose and wire Kafka locally.

# Order Management System

This is a microservices-based Order Management System designed to streamline the ordering process. The system consists of four core services:

- **Kitchen Service**: Manages meal preparation and kitchen workflows.  
- **Order Service**: Handles customer orders, updates, and tracking.  
- **Payment Service**: Processes payments and manages transaction records.  
- **Stock Service**: Tracks inventory levels and ensures stock availability.

Each service is independently developed using **Golang**, making the system scalable, maintainable, and efficient.
